            Sophia Perez became interested in art at a young age. She didn't know until high school what she wanted to do with it. She fell in love with the art of graphic design and decided to pursue it at North Platte Community College. She is into her second year here and is more passionate than ever about the art of design. She hopes that one day she can create her own business and create art with her original characters to share with others. </p>
